I've found Gailey's description of digital editing very inspiring.

In particular, I was struck by the paradoxical polarization of reading practices that she describes in the first section. As she explains, the taggers and the transcribers of a digital edition often encounter a richer, more productive task than those who work on a regular edition; they are prompted to ask unconventional questions, and to consider texts and artifacts in new ways. On the other hand, the users of digital editions are in most cases superficial "searchers," discouraged from engaging with the text in innovative ways.

But is "heavy editing" (non-standard and interpretive editing) a true answer to this imbalance? Doesn't it instead further disempower end-users, by providing them with ready-made searchable patterns (tags that have already been predicted by editors) and second-hand discoveries? The second solution that she proposes sounds more convincing. Instead of making editing "heavier," we should keep thinking about ways (tools, interfaces) that can turn digital reading and searching - for the end-user - into an active process of intellectual exploration.
