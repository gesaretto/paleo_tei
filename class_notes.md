# Introduction to _The O's of Saint Bridget_

1. Affective Piety; the 15 O's;

  - Suffering of characters, empathy; __participation through prayer__;

  - Related to the idea of empathy and participation, we find a strange __preoccupation for numbers__ (listing, numbering; __the five joys of the virgin__; __the seven last utterances of Jesus on the Cross__);

    - The _15 O's_ contains the seven utterances, for instance (folded into the text);

    - We also find a certain obsession for __the number of Christ's wounds__ (wound on the side, wound in the heart);

    - __5480__ (15 * 365 = 5475 - plus the __5__ wounds);

    - _a female solitary obsessed with the number of wounds of Christ_; in the same vision, the solitary receives a vision of prophecies involving the number __15__ (in 1954 the Church determined that, although the O's could be printed, the promises shouldn't);

    - the idea is that these 15 O's should be _portable_, hence the small roll (and the very small format of the first printed edition);

    - _Bridget of Sweden_ - visionary, spent some time in Rome; had seven children; she founded an order, thanks to a pope who spent some time in Rome during the _Avignonese_ period;

    - translated into English and German (pretty unusual in its Northern tradition);

    - vernacular theology is suppressed in the Arundel constitutions of 1408; __but__ suppression of doctrinal writing __does not coincide__ with suppression of _deviotional writing_; therefore, there is very little that's _dangerous_ about the 15 O's.

  2. __Rolls__ are of course typical in the antique tradition; but we shouldn't assume that they disappear with the introduction of the codex; an example is, for instance, is the __exalted roll__ - with images reproduced __upside-down__ (so that the audience could see them, when the the speaker went through it);

# Working on the Roll

1. LLEM (Linguistic Atlas of Middle English)

2. The script: gothic bookhand formata; a high level script. But this is a crammy practitioner (and one who rarely cuts his pen);

3. Very little abbreviation (basically no abbreviation); also, only a single non-Latin character (Yogh, and apparently only once);

4. weird characters: a majuscule _K_ used for a minuscule _K_ (looks like a regular k to me);

  - a peculiar _y_ with a little dot over it (might be confused with a pendule abbreviation for __r__; but it's simply an otiose dot).

    - therefore, be careful whether letters are __y__ or __p__;

    - (also, be careful when you look at _a_ - it has the middle stroke; nothing more than two minims with a cross stroke);

  - also, we find very often fused __de__ letters;

  - we also have a huge minuscule __w__;

  - __IHU__ for Jesus Jhesu (?);

  - straight line over a vowel - _n_ letter (another kind of abbreviation);

5. Many otiose lines;

6. Look for abbreviations (there aren't many); it's either __n__ (the stroke on top of a letter) or __er__ (probably the top curl);

7. A single non-Latin letter, it appears only in initial position (as a capital letter) - it's a seven with a cross stroke;

# Cataloguing

- Various lengths and degrees of detail for various kinds of purposes; book sellers, for instance, provide lots of detail (because they need to sell the thing);

- Three categories:

  - material - physical condition (what it is...);

    - binding (contemporary to the creation);

  - intellectual (contents...);

    - language, script;

    - text, images...

    - absence or presence of marginalia;

  - provenance (where it's from, when, who...);

    - some people distinguish between __origin__ and __provenance__ (the place and time of creation, and the history of its transmission);

    - binding (later);

    - absence or presence of marginalia;

  - So, the difference between __provenance__ and __object content__ is apparently crucial.

  - A good standard is that of the __digital scriptorium__ (you have to consider time/convenience/thoroughness);

    - it takes one three days per manuscript, according to CD.
